// - sell soda to students at some cost.
// - DONE -- Each vending machine is passed an id in the range [0, NumVendingMachines) for identification, 
// and the MSRP price for a bottle of soda. 


// - DONE - A new vending machine is empty (no stock) and begins by registering with the name server.


// - student calls buy to obtain one of their favourite sodas. 

// - vending machine first checks if the student has sufficient funds to purchase the soda a
// - vending machine second checks if specified soda is available


// - then the studentâ€™s WATCard is debited by the cost of a soda. -- note that we will have to check if the watcard exists
//     - raise exceptions Funds or Stock, respectively. 
// - Once a purchase is possible, there is a 1 in 5 chance the soda is free, which is indicated by raising exception Free

// - Periodically, the truck comes by to restock the vending machines with new soda from the bottlig plant
// - Restocking has two steps:
//     - calls inventory to return a pointer to an array containing the amount of each kind of soda currently in the vending machine.
//     - truck uses this information to transfer as much of its
// stock as fits into the machine; for each kind of soda, no more than MaxStockPerFlavour per flavour can be added
// to a machine.
//     - After transferring new soda into the machine by directly modifying the array passed from inventory, the truck calls restocked to indicate the operation is complete
// - The vending machine cannot accept buy calls during restocking
// - the cost member returns the cost of purchasing a soda for this machine. 
// - The getId member returns the identification number of the vending machine.
