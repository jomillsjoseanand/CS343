// - The WATCard manages the money associated with a card. 
// // -- When a WATCard is created, it has a $0 balance.
// - A courier calls deposit after a funds transfer
// - A vending machine calls withdraw when a soda is purchased. 
// - A student and a vending machine call getBalance to determine the balance.
// - FWATCard is a future pointer to a studentâ€™s WATCard for synchronizing access 
// to the WATCard between the student and the courier.
